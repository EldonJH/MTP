# About me

Hello, my name is Eldon Hinshaw, and I am studying software engineering at the University of Missouri. This is my first semester here at Mizzou and I completed my associates degree at MACC before transferring. I am currently taking 1000 and 1040 and have been enjoying this curriculum very much and I am excited for what I will learn in the semesters to come.
